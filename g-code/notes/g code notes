M110
Discussion
Commands sent by host software during a printing session can optionally include a line number and a checksum that Marlin will check for validity. This allows hosts to catch communication errors and retry commands that don't get through. Usually the Line Number starts at 1 and continues sequentially, but if a host is resuming a print job or combining jobs it could start or continue at any point in the sequence. This command allows the Line Number to be set to a new value in such cases.

Notes
Marlin 1.0.2 and earlier do not support the long form of this command.
The short form of this command is a Marlin-specific feature.
If hosts use either the N500 M110 or N123 M110 N500 form they must also include the * checksum.



M190


Description
Optionally set the target temperature for the heated bed, then wait in a loop until that target temperature is reached.

Examples
 M190      ; Wait for the heated bed to reach target temperature
 M190 S190 ; Set the heated bed temperature and wait
Arguments
 S<celsius> Optional. The temperature to set and wait for. Don't wait if cooling down.
 R<celsius> Optional. The temperature to set and wait for. Always wait.





 m104

 M104 S190
Set the temperature of the current extruder to 190oC and return control to the host immediately (i.e. before that temperature has been reached by the extruder). Duet-dc42 and other firmware also supports the optional T parameter (as generated by slic3r) to specify which tool the command applies to. See also M109.

This is deprecated because temperatures should be set using the G10 and T commands (q.v.).

Deprecation is subject to discussion. --Traumflug 11:33, 19 July 2012 (UTC)
